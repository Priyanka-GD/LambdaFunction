AWS Lambda for Chat AI Integration

📝 Overview

This AWS Lambda function serves as the AI processing unit for a chat application. It integrates with Amazon Bedrock to generate AI responses and is invoked whenever a user sends a message.

🎯 Purpose

The Lambda function is designed to:

Receive user messages from an API Gateway request.
Call Amazon Bedrock (Titan AI model) to generate a response.
Return the AI-generated response to the Angular frontend via the API Gateway.

🛠️ How It Works

User Input → A chat message is sent from the frontend.
Lambda Execution → AWS Lambda processes the request and forwards it to Amazon Bedrock.
AI Response → The Bedrock AI model generates a response.
Return to Frontend → The AI response is sent back to the Angular chat app.

📌 Key Features

✅ Stateless & Serverless → AWS Lambda eliminates the need for dedicated backend servers.

✅ AI-Powered Responses → Uses Amazon Bedrock's Titan model for natural language responses.

✅ Scalable & Cost-Effective → Lambda scales automatically based on usage.

✅ API Gateway Integration → Easily accessible via HTTP requests from the frontend.

🚀 Deployment & Execution

1️⃣ Prerequisites

AWS CLI installed & configured

AWS Lambda setup with API Gateway

Amazon Bedrock access

🛡️ Security Considerations

IAM Roles & Permissions → Ensure Lambda has access to Bedrock API.

API Gateway Authentication → Consider using JWT tokens for secure access.

Rate Limiting → Protect against excessive API calls.
